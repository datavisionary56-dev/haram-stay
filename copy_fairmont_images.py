He told the Andrew Marr show that he would “not be quiet” during the election and said that he is leaving parliament “for now” but hinted he could return.

The former Chancellor said he “wants to be part of the debate” in the Conservative party, adding that he will “fight” for the Britain he loves from the editor’s chair.

Osborne’s resignation follows his appointment as editor of the Evening Standard, a decision which has been criticised by politicians on all sides, with many calling for him to step down.

Asked whether he would like to return to parliament, he told the BBC: “I’m stepping down from the House of Commons – for now. But I will remain active in the debate about our country’s future and on the causes I care about, like the power of the North.

“At the age of 45, I don’t want to spend the rest of my life just being an ex-chancellor. I want new challenges.

“I’m very excited about the opportunity to edit the Evening Standard. I’ve met the team there, and their energy and commitment to one of the great newspapers of our time is impressive.

“I am coming to this job as an admirer of good journalism and the people who produce it.”

Osborne has been appointed to edit the London newspaper despite having no experience in journalism.

His resignation will trigger a by-election in his Tatton constituency, which he has held since 2001.

In his resignation letter, he wrote: “I am stepping down from the House of Commons – for now. But I will remain active in the debate about our country’s future and on the causes I care about, like the power of the North.

“I’m very excited about the opportunity to edit the Evening Standard. I’ve met the team there, and their energy and commitment to one of the great newspapers of our time is impressive.

“I am coming to this job as an admirer of good journalism and the people who produce it.

“But I leave behind me in Tatton a constituency that I love and where I have made many friends. I will miss representing the people of Tatton, but I will continue to work for them in other ways.”

His decision to quit comes after he was sacked by May from his role as Chancellor in July last year.

He had been widely tipped to succeed David Cameron as Prime Minister, but his career stalled after the Brexit vote.

Osborne has since been critical of May’s government, particularly over her handling of Brexit.

In an article for the Evening Standard last month, he warned that a “hard Brexit” would be a “act of economic vandalism”.

He also criticised the government’s approach to immigration, saying it was “not the answer” to the country’s problems.

His appointment as editor of the Evening Standard was met with surprise and criticism from politicians and journalists alike.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called it a “mockery” of the political system, while Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said it was “an insult to the people of Tatton”.

However, Osborne defended his decision, saying he wanted to “take on the powerful” and “give a voice to Londoners”.

He is due to take up his new role in May.
